You won't notice a difference. You can also force it to load the full resolution image by ctrl + clicking the image preview. the first resolution on bottom right will turn red when it's enabled.
#### Behavior settings
##### Use search API
Without this, you'll only be able to view images currently cached in Discord.
##### Trigger search when hovering over navigation buttons when needed
Sometimes, if there's under 5 images left, it will wait for you to press the correct arrow key, or hover over the navigation button itself, once you do that it searches for more images. Setting this to false simply makes it only do that when you click the button instead of hover it.
